# Nuxt Starter

## Getting started

### Prerequisites/Dependencies

You will need the following installed on your system:

- mise
- Node.js (via mise)
- pnpm (via mise)
- Docker

### Setup

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fairdataihub/nuxt-starter.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   mise trust # only needed if you are using mise on this project for the first time
   mise install
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Add your environment variables. An example is provided at `.env.example`

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. Open the application in your browser

   ```bash
   open http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Development

### Database

The application uses a PostgreSQL database for storing data. You can use Docker to run these services locally.

```bash
docker-compose -f ./dev-docker-compose.yaml up
docker-compose -f ./dev-docker-compose.yaml up -d # if you want the db to run in the background
```

Close the database with:

```bash
docker-compose -f ./dev-docker-compose.yaml down
```

### Prisma

The application uses Prisma to interact with the database.

#### Kysely support

This template supports both Prisma and Kysely by design.

- Use Prisma for schema management, migrations, and generated types/client.
- Use Kysely when you need more explicit SQL composition, advanced joins, or query-builder ergonomics.

Why both:

- Complex reporting or performance-sensitive queries can be written in Kysely without abandoning type safety.
- You keep one source of truth for schema/migrations while still having low-level control where it matters.

Example API routes are included for both approaches under [server/api/thing](server/api/thing) (Prisma) and [server/api/kysely-thing](server/api/kysely-thing) (Kysely).

### UI

The application uses [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com) to build the UI components. It also uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.
